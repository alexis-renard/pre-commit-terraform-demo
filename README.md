# Demo pre-commit

This is a vanilla terraform layer.

## Demo workflow

The idea is now to present a basic terraform module and the first community hooks we are going to use :
* tflint, terraform_fmt and where we are gathering them from
* modifying the format and running the `pre-commit run --all` command to showcase pre-commit's behavior
